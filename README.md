# RNAseq-Analysis

<b><u> Pipeline for processing and analysing RNA sequencing 50bp single reads </b></u><br>

Utilises Samtools, bowtie2, and feature counts for file manipulation, read alignment and read annotation. <br>

Processing methods are detailed in rnaseq_fastq_processing_pipeline.sh <br>

Differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2 in R is explained in DEG_using_DESeq2.Rdata <br>
